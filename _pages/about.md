## About Me
I'm a first year Ph.D student at [Computer Science Department](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/), [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). The pronunciation of my name is "Ray Tsai"(You can call me Yanson or Luis). My research interest includes multimodal machine learning and large language models. I am an enthusiastic fan of [Synthetic Ascension](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Traditions#Synthetics). Synthetic Ascension represents the ultimate technological evolution path where organic consciousness is transferred to advanced mechanical bodies, transcending biological limitations and opening new frontiers of existence and exploration.

<div style="display:none">I had a wonderful RA intern at HKUST(GZ), advised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Chao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=j08V64UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiangliang-zhang/) and [Dr. Shichao Pei](https://scpei.github.io/) of MINE Lab from [College of Engineering](https://engineering.nd.edu/), University of Notre Dame. I had a one-semester visit in Columbia University and luckily advised by [Prof.James Anderson](http://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/). I spent my wonderful sophomore year advised by [Prof. Pengju Ren](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/pengjuren) from [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://iair.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an Jiaotong University. I was enrolled in Youth Gifted Program of Xi'an Jiaotong University at 2018, and graduated at 2020.</div>
